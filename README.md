**LineairDB is a fast transactional key-value storage library. It provides transaction processing for multiple keys with strict serializability.**

### Features

---

- Keys and values are arbitrary byte arrays.
- The basic operations are read(key), write(key, value), ExecuteTransaction(procedure, callback).
- Changes in a transaction for multiple key-value pairs are made with atomicity and durability.
- Concurrent transactions are processed with strict serializability.
- In contended write-heavy workloads, high scalability for many-core CPUs is provided.

### Notes

---

- LineairDB is not an SQL (Relational) database.
- There is no client-server support in the library (i.e., LineairDB is an embedded database).

### Usage

```c++

#include <lineairdb/lineairdb.h>

int main() {
  {
    LineairDB::Database db;
    LineairDB::TxStatus status;

    // Execute: enqueue a transaction with an expected callback
    db.ExecuteTransaction(
        [](LineairDB::Transaction& tx) {
          auto alice = tx.Read<int>("alice");
          if (alice.has_value()) {
            int alice = alice.value();
          }
          tx.Write<int>("bob", 1);
        },
        [&](LineairDB::TxStatus s) { status = s; });

    // Fence: Block-wait until all running transactions are terminated
    db.Fence();
    // status == LineairDB::TxStatus::Committed;
  }
}
```

### Getting the Source

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/lineairdb/lineairdb.git
```

### Building

Quick start:

```
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .. && make && sudo make install
```

Then you can use LineairDB by including the header `include/lineairdb/lineairdb.h`.

### Compatibility

We have been tested LineairDB in the following environments:

- Apple clang version 11.0.3
- Clang >= 6 on Linux
- GCC >= 9

### Documentation

[The LineairDB library documentation](https://lineairdb.github.io/LineairDB/) is available.

You can also build it by simply running

```
doxygen
```

and open `docs/build/html/index.html`.

Technical detail of concurrency control protocols such as SiloNWR is also available in the research paper [at this link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08119).
The project roadmap is [here](./docs/roadmap.md).

### Benchmark Results

The followings are our benchmark results.
This is a modified benchmark of [YCSB-A](https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB); unlike official YCSB in which a transaction operates a single key, each transaction operates on four keys in our benchmark.

This benchmark is executed in the following environments:

|                              |                                                   |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| CPU                          | four Intel Xeon E7-8870 (total 144 logical cores) |
| Memory                       | 1TB (no swap-out)                                 |
| YCSB Table size              | 100K                                              |
| YCSB Record size             | 8-bytes                                           |
| Epoch size                   | 1000ms                                            |
| Contention (Î¸)               | 0.9 (highly contended)                            |
| # of threads to process txns | 70                                                |

#### YCSB-A

<img src=./docs/image/epoch1000.json.png width=400px/>

SiloNWR, our novel concurrency control protocol, achieves excellent performance over 10 Million transaction per seconds (TPS) by omitting transactions without exclusive lockings.
Note that YCSB-A has an operation ratio of Read 50% and (Blind) Write 50%; that is, this is a fairly favorable setting for NWR-protocols.
If your use case is such a blind write-intensive, then LineairDB can be a great solution.
